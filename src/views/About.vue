        MedVax Health is a health technology company on a mission to bridge
        healthcare gaps through low-cost technology, resilient anti-counterfeit
        supply chains, and last-mile delivery solutions. We ensure that
        regardless of geographical barriers, climate disruptions and fragmented
        healthcare supply chains, life-saving medications, vaccines, and
        reproductive health products reach the most vulnerable communities, and
        those who need them most, with a special commitment to bridging the
        health equity gap for women and girls. We are currently operational in
        Nigeria, with a vision to expand across Africa.
